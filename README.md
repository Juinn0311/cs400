Once upon a semester there were a group of 8 students paired together in a CS400 group project. They were strangers to each other, yet they all shared a common purpose and task: to get an A in CS400, and so began their long journey. Te first task that they encountered was nonetheless but the first group project. It involved the team in implementing a hashTable to create a project that would have practical value in the real world. The group was hopeful and excited but unfortunately, one of the members never arrived and so only the seven remaining was left to finish the first task.
